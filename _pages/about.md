Hi! I’m Seth, a data scientist with Booz Allen Hamilton conducting work for the U.S. Government. I am a data science generalist, with broad skills across the data science lifecycle, and deep domain expertise with Defense and the Intelligence Community. I also have experience in Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, and am currently increasing my hands-on-keyboard technical skills with Scikit-learn and PyTorch. I also tinker with LLMs implementing RAG and MCPs. I am also a retired Army Reservist, having reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in Military Intelligence. I deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan (a single deployment which encompassed both places), Bosnia, and Panama. My units included 20th Special Forces Group, 10th Mountain Division, and various operational and strategic assignments.


## My work and research

My career has followed three disciplines: finance; data analytics & science; and defense & the intelligence community. As a finance specialist, I worked for Merrill Lynch as a financial consultant, PricewaterhouseCoopers as a financial auditor, and for the Joint Special Operations Command as a counter-threat finance analyst, and also completed a Master of Science in Accountancy. As a data analyst and data scientist, I worked for Solectron Corporation (purchased by Flextronics), Booz Allen Hamilton (at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency), as a contractor for the Defense Intelligence Agency, as a contractor for the Office of Naval Intelligence, as a contractor for the Joint Special Operations Command, and on orders as an Army officer. As a defense and intelligence specialist, I served a 34-year career as an Army intelligence officer, where I conducted intelligence analysis and led intelligence organizations. As a contractor, all of my work as a data scientist was within the Intelligence Community. Finally, I am a graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and also graduated from the National Intelligence University with a Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence, and from UCLA with a BA in Political Science (International Relations).


## My background and history

I was born in Canada, and grew up in Los Angeles, California, where I attended UCLA. I have lived in the Washington, D.C. area for over almost 20 years, the place where I have lived the longest. I have also lived in the San Francisco bay area, Northern New York state, and Georgia.
My entire adult life has been consumed by service in the Army, having served on Active Duty, in the National Guard, and in the Army Reserve. I first enlisted in the Army in 1991, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1997. Leaving the Army is bittersweet, but allows me to fully focus on my career as a data scientist.
I have two children aged 15 and 11, and a Belgian Malinois named Argo, who is a very sweet and friendly dog.
I speak English fluently and Spanish conversationally, and I love backpacking in Latin America.


## My intellectual communities

I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating the three focuses mentioned above, while also deeply interested in history and conducting coding projects on my own time. At various times I have been a member of community of interest groups serving data science, performance management, design thinking, and the military.
